    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a first-class BS Biomedical Engineering graduate who gets genuinely excited about turning ideas into actual things. I'm fluent in English, conversational in French, and always curious about how design, engineering, and storytelling can work together to solve interesting problems.

I go by the alias "The Space Nomad," which sounds way cooler than it is. Really, it just means I'm comfortable exploring unfamiliar territory, whether that's a new software, a tricky design problem, or a creative idea I have no business attempting yet. I tend to wander between disciplines, picking up tools and techniques along the way.

I spend a lot of my time playing around with tools that help me think through ideas visually and technically. SolidWorks and Blender are where I go when I want to see if something looks as good in 3D as it does in my head. ANSYS is my reality check for when intuition isn't enough and I need to understand what's happening under the surface.
On the creative side, I use Photoshop and Illustrator to experiment with visuals and branding, and Premiere Pro when I want to tell a story that needs movement and sound. 
These aren't just programs to me, they're different ways of thinking out loud.
I'm what you'd call coachable. Not in a "I have no opinions" way, but in a "show me a better way and I'll absolutely run with it" way. I like learning from people whether they know more than I do or not.  I want feedback (even when it stings a little), and I'm fine admitting when I'm figuring things out as I go. Growth usually starts with someone pointing out the smarter approach you didn't see.
At the end of the day, I'm curious, adaptable, and motivated by the idea of getting a little better at something every day. I thrive in spaces where learning, creativity, and thoughtful problem-solving are encouraged. Always looking for the next opportunity to grow, one project and one lesson at a time.
